## Turf is a menial-admin-less, customizable, secure, intelligently automated, and fully integrated application suite

We all hate menial admin, right? I would love to be able to focus on only doing the stuff Iâ€™m good at, rather than have to fill in forms, keep things up to date, and chase team members.
This is exactly what we at Turf are looking to solve across all operational platforms a business needs. Turf is a one-stop-shop for organisations that need anything from project management to customer relationship management, human resources and more, removing the need to purchase and maintain software for each application. 

We are creating tools that recognise user behaviour and automate/enhance this - reducing time spent on admin and keeping people productive.
