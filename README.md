## Turf is a menial-admin-less, customizable, secure, intelligently automated, and fully integrated application suite

We all hate menial admin, right? I would love to be able to focus on only doing the stuff Iâ€™m good at, rather than have to fill in forms, keep things up to date, and chase team members.
This is exactly what we at Turf are looking to solve across all operational platforms a business needs. Turf is a one-stop-shop for organisations that need anything from project management to customer relationship management, human resources and more, removing the need to purchase and maintain software for each application. 

We are creating tools that recognise user behaviour and automate/enhance this - reducing time spent on admin and keeping people productive.

# Contributing
As Turf is open source, contributions from new and existing contributors are always welcome! To successfully merge your contributions, in addition to proper coding practices, we ask that you follow a few simple steps to maintain consistency.
## Prerequisites
1. have node.js installed
2. have git installed
3. have experience with react and typescript
4. if working on a backend issue, have familiarity with postgres and supabase
5. have supabase CLI and docker installed (to run supabase containers for local development)
## How to Merge a Contribution
1. Clone the repository
2. Pick an existing, unassigned, and open issue. If this is your first contribution, you may want to pick an issue that is labeled as a "good first issue".
4. Create a branch off of the main branch linked to that issue following the naming convention `features/category/feature` where category and feature are the real category and feature names
5. When you have completed development, open up a pull request to merge into main with your issue attached. Our core maintainers will then review your PR and when everything looks good, it will be merged!
